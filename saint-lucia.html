<p>The island, with its fine natural harbor at Castries and burgeoning sugar industry, was contested by England and France throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries (changing possession 14 times); it was finally ceded to the UK in 1814 and became part of the British Windward Islands colony. 
Even after the abolition of slavery on its plantations in <time datetime="1834">1834</time>, Saint Lucia remained an agricultural island, dedicated to producing tropical commodity crops.</p>
<p>In the mid-20th century, Saint Lucia joined the West Indies Federation and in 1967 became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. 
In 1979, Saint Lucia gained full independence.</p>
